# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with OpenAI
This code uses the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis on recent tweets about a specific stock.
## Prerequisites
You will need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain by signing up for an account at https://beta.openai.com/signup.

You will also need a set of Twitter API credentials, which you can obtain by creating a Twitter Developer account at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api.

## Usage
Install the required libraries: pip install openai tweepy
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key, and replace YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY, YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET, YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET with your Twitter API credentials.
Replace STOCK_SYMBOL with the symbol of the stock you want to analyze.
Run the script: python sentiment_analysis.py

The script will search Twitter for recent tweets that include the stock symbol, and use the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis on each tweet. The resulting sentiment data will be printed to the console.

## Notes
The Twitter API has rate limiting policies that may affect the number of tweets that can be searched and analyzed.
The OpenAI API has usage limits that may affect the number of requests that can be made. Please review the OpenAI API terms of use before using this code.
